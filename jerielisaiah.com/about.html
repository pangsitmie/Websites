      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <h1>I’m Jeriel</h1>
      <h3>Computer Science student in Taiwan</h3>
      <p>
        I’ve spent the past 12+ years working across different areas of digital
        design; front-end development, email design, marketing site pages, app
        UI/UX, to my current role designing products for mobile platforms.
        <br />
        <br />
        These days my time is spent researching, designing, prototyping, and
        coding. I also help designers get started with their careers. Out of the
        office you’ll find me dreaming of soccer, playing bass guitar, and
        petting all the good dogs.

        graduated from my highschool. I continue my study as a Computer Science
        Bachelor in National Yunlin University of Science and Technology,
        Taiwan.
        <br />
        <br />
        With all these experiences I am confident to say that I am fluent in
        these languages. <br />

        I studied my Computer Science資訊工程系 bachelor’s degree in National
        Yunlin University of Science and Technology 雲林科技大學.
        <br /><br />
        As an overseas student I know that I might lack in some aspects.
        However, that doesn't stop me from putting extra effort compared to my
        classmates. I studied earlier, longer, and harder
