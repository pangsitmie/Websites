Welcome to my Github repository! This repository contains all of my website projects, including my portfolio project, which can be found in the `jeriel-portfolio` folder.

## About My Portfolio Project

The `jeriel-portfolio` folder contains the code for my portfolio project. This project showcases my skills and previous work experience. It includes information about myself, my education, and my work experience. It also includes a gallery of my previous projects, where you can see the different types of websites that I have built.

In addition to my portfolio project, this repository contains other website projects that I have worked on. These projects include a blog website, an e-commerce website, and a social media website. Each project has its own folder within this repository, where you can explore the code and see how I built these websites.

## Code Quality

I take pride in writing clean, efficient, and well-documented code. I use best practices and follow coding standards to ensure that my code is easy to understand, maintain, and scale. I am always looking for ways to improve my coding skills and welcome any feedback or suggestions you may have.
