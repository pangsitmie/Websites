# Websites

Welcome to my website repository! Here, you can find all of my website projects, including my website portfolio, which is located in the jeriel-portfolio-vite-ts folder.

## Portfolio Project

My website portfolio showcases my skills and previous work experience. It includes information about me, my education, and my work experience. You can also find a gallery of my previous projects, where you can see the different types of websites I have built. Check it out at https://jerielisaiah.com/.

## Other Projects

Aside from my portfolio project, you can also find other website projects that I have worked on in this repository. These projects include some websites that I am currently working on and some practice websites. Each project has its own folder within this repository, where you can explore the code and see how I built these websites.

## Code Quality

I take pride in writing clean, efficient, and well-documented code. I follow best practices and coding standards to ensure that my code is easy to understand, maintain, and scale. I am always looking for ways to improve my coding skills and welcome any feedback or suggestions you may have.
